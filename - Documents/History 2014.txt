History 2014



[01-Feb-2014]
/ Implement 12 possible ways to convert quaternion to euler angles.



[02-Feb-2014]
/ Fix reading-in and writing-out of "anim+bone" data.



[03-Feb-2014]
/ Find right conversion to use out of the 12 possible ways to convert quaternion to euler angles.



[04-Feb-2014]
- Fix use of $concave for the collision mesh of L4D2's van.mdl.



[09-Feb-2014]
/ Based on a bug report from atrblizzard decompiling a VTM:B model, I changed some lines in SourceQcFile.
	Changed from:
		Me.WriteHboxRelatedCommands()
	To:
		If theSourceEngineModel.theMdlFileHeader.theHitboxSets IsNot Nothing Then
			Me.WriteHboxRelatedCommands()
		End If



[11-Feb-2014]
/ Fix use of $concave for the collision mesh of L4D2's van.mdl.


[12-Feb-2014]
/ BUG: QC file $texturegroup does not list the texture file names correctly for TF2's "models\weapons\v_models\v_medigun_medic.mdl"
/ BUG: Static prop ref meshes are not rotated correctly.
/ Tweaked the $animation and $sequence lines in the qc file.



[13-Feb-2014]
/ IDEA: Comment-out $cbox qc line, and indicate it is unlikely used.
/ IDEA: If $hbox is automatically generated, comment-out the $hbox lines.
/ Fix up the name used for ref and lod mesh smd file name. 
	* Sometimes, a file name has redundant name within it, such as "van_van.smd" and "van_van_lod1.smd".
X Change from using "*_hlmv.qc" to using "*_hlmv.crowbarqc".
	* The compiler always changes the extension to qc.
/ Fix the qc lines of the blended sequences and animations.
	/ Commented-out subtract, addlayer, and delta for both $animation and $sequence.

=== Crowbar 0.14
========================================



[14-Feb-2014]
/ Add "DecompileFolderName" to AppSettings.
/ Use default value for "DecompileFolderName" of: "decompiled" + the Crowbar version number.
/ DEV: Add "DecompileMdlPathFileName" to AppSettings.
/ Change name of tabs to nouns, such as "Decompiler" and "Compiler".
/ IDEA: Move the Decompile Log to its own tab page, along with related widgets.
- DEV: Move each tab page's widgets to a user control.
- Disable Decompiler widgets when decompiling.
- Disable Compiler widgets when compiling.



[15-Feb-2014]
/ DEV: Move each tab page's widgets to a user control.
/ IDEA: Include link to steam group on the About tabpage.



[18-Feb-2014]
/ Use 128x128 version of the Crowbar icon on the About page.
/ Remove the horizontal crowbar image from the Decompile page.
/ BUG: Typing C: into Output folder textbox and moving away from textbox cause its text to disappear.
/ BUG: Tab order (tabbing between widgets) is messed up.
- BUG: Right-click a QC file and choose "open with > Crowbar", It opens it in the DECOMPILE tab, in the MDL file bar.
	* It should open in the Compile tab.
- IDEA: Error report should have the following info:
	- mdl or qc file name, depending on decompiling or compiling
	- paths used in the decompile or compile

=== Crowbar 0.15
========================================



[19-Feb-2014]
/ BUG: 0.15 added 8 bytes to read in for version 49 mdl files, but that breaks some L4D2 version 49 models.
	SOLUTION: Analyze offsets to determine when the extra bytes are used and adjust accordingly.
/ BUG: "Cancel Decompile" button is not enabled during decompiling.
/ BUG: Right-click a QC file and choose "open with > Crowbar", It opens it in the DECOMPILE tab, in the MDL file bar.
	* It should open in the Compile tab.
- IDEA: Use radio buttons for the two options of giving the folder to put decompiled files.
- IDEA: Use checkboxes for different types of files to decompile.
	- Default to having all boxes checked.
	* Example:
		- QC file
			- Include extra info as comments
		- Reference mesh SMD file
			- Apply the L4D2 survivor "right-hand fix"
		- Collision mesh SMD file
		- Animation VTA file (face flexes)
		- Animation SMD files
			- Include debug info
		- Procedural bones VRD file
		- Debug info files

[21-Feb-2014]
- BUG: Crowbar hangs when end of compile using Dota 2's compiler is used, due to "hit a key to continue".



[22-Feb-2014]
/ BUG: Context menu with Copy and Select All missing from the two log textboxes.
/ Fixed VRD file values? Seems fixed for L4D2 Zoey.



[24-Feb-2014]

[25-Feb-2014]

=== Crowbar 0.16
========================================



[26-Feb-2014]
/ BUG: Anim frames above 30 in some models are not decompiled correctly.
	* CAUSE: Crowbar did not handle "aniamtion sections".

=== Crowbar 0.17
