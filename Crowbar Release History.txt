Crowbar 0.12
Changes since previous release

<ul>
<li>"Recompile" button on "Compile Log" tab for quicker testing.</li>
<li>Enable the "View compiled model in HLMV" button when compiled for game.</li>
<li>FIX: Reference mesh SMD file of Source Filmmaker's TF2 HWM models now decompiles with valid SMD syntax. There are still some issues with bad flex lines (which can be commented out for compiling) and some missing SMD files for some player models.</li>
</ul>



Crowbar 0.19
Changes since previous (public) release

<li>Some interface changes</li>
<li>Decompiler tab shows options for selecting what to decompile</li>
<li>Decompile Log in its own tab</li>
<li>Compiler tab now allows for "batch" compiling, via two new buttons at bottom</li>
<li>"Compile to Model Viewer" button replaced with a checkbox option for "Compile to different subfolder" (to explain more accurately what Crowbar actually does and to make it convenient for "batch" compiling)</li>

<li>Animations found in a mesh mdl file are decompiled into smd files (NOTE: Blended animations are not decompiled correctly for re-compiling, but will look decent in a 3D tool. I will continue to work on decompiling the blended animations so that they can be properly recompiled.)</li>
<li>Long animations (those that used "sections" on compile) are fully and properly decompiled</li>
<li>Certain meshes, such as those from Dota 2, SFM, and TF2 models are now fully decompiled</li>
<li>Concave physics meshes are properly decompiled and properly set up for recompiling</li>

<li>Fixed and cleaned up some of the qc stuff</li>
<li>Fixed the $texturegroup lines, particularly noticeable in TF2 player model decompiles</li>
<li>Fixed use of right-clicking a QC file and choosing "Open with.. Crowbar", so Crowbar now opens correctly in the Compiler tab with the qc file selected.</li>

<li>Saving of window placement, window size, options, and values between Crowbar sessions</li>

<li>Various bug fixes</li>
