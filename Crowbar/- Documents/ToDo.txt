################################################################################

- BUG: Compared with teenangst zoey, this section doesn't match exactly (and this might matter): $texturegroup "skinfamilies"
	* This might be okay as it is. The mdl file seems to list all textures for each group, 
		even if same texture name is in same index in all groups (meaning it "replaces" itself).
	- Check if SourceMdlTexture "flags" and "used" fields hold any useful info.
- BUG: Incorrect "split" values for eyelid lines in qc file.
	Teenangst Zoey source qc lines:
		eyelid  upper_right $expressions$ lowerer 1 -0.19 neutral 0 0.13 raiser 2 0.27 split 0.1 eyeball righteye
		eyelid  lower_right $expressions$ lowerer 3 -0.32 neutral 0 -0.19 raiser 4 -0.02 split 0.1 eyeball righteye
		eyelid  upper_left $expressions$ lowerer 1 -0.19 neutral 0 0.13 raiser 2 0.27 split -0.1 eyeball lefteye
		eyelid  lower_left $expressions$ lowerer 3 -0.32 neutral 0 -0.19 raiser 4 -0.02 split -0.1 eyeball lefteye
	Crowbar lines:
		eyelid upper_right "zoeyp.vta" lowerer 1 -0.19 neutral 0 0.13 raiser 3 0.27 split 1 eyeball "eye_right"
		eyelid lower_right "zoeyp.vta" lowerer 5 -0.32 neutral 0 -0.19 raiser 7 -0.02 split 1 eyeball "eye_right"
		eyelid upper_left "zoeyp.vta" lowerer 9 -0.19 neutral 0 0.13 raiser 11 0.27 split -1 eyeball "eye_left"
		eyelid lower_left "zoeyp.vta" lowerer 13 -0.32 neutral 0 -0.19 raiser 15 -0.02 split -1 eyeball "eye_left"
- BUG: Incorrect "split" value in flexpair qc options. (Might be same as eyelid "split" value decompile.)
- BUG: Compared with teenangst zoey source files, these lines are extra in Crowbar decompile within $jigglebone is_flexible blocks:
			allow_length_flex
			along_stiffness 100
			along_damping 0
			pitch_friction 0
			pitch_bounce 0
			yaw_friction 0
			yaw_bounce 0
- BUG: [Reported by Stay Puft] Skin families are not as expected for common infected, as compared to what is shown in HLMV.
- BUG: Decompiling an mdl file located in a long absolute path raises exception.
- BUG: If a game setup is incorrect, Crowbar does not give any indication that it can't compile.
- BUG: Decompiler widgets are not disabled when decompiling.
- BUG: Compiler widgets are not disabled when compiling.

	

### PLANNED FEATURES
################################################################################


=== Decompiling ===

- Round floating point values to nearest 5th decimal place, such as in this example:
	{ event 5004 60.000002682209 "Taunt.Engineer01FootStompLight" }
	That 60.000002682209 could be changed to 60.
- Have option to decompile with certain formatting so that existing smd importers will work correctly with them.
	- Do not have spaces at the start of "time" lines. [Reported that this affects Milkshape and MESA.]
	- Fill-in VTA file's "skeleton time" sections with bone data, 
		so that it matches example VTA files found in sourcesdk.
- Warn user if exiting while decompile is in progress.
- Option to decompile each model to its own folder with same name as the model.
	* Especially useful for batch decompiling.
- Option to (not) use subfolders for the logs and anims.
	- Need to change names of the logs and anims if placed in same folder as the qc.


=== Compiling ===

- Auto-detect game setup paths.
	* Check for this key: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Valve\Steam
		with this string name: SteamPath
		with a value like this: c:/program files (x86)/steam
		Add "\steamapps\common" to that path. 
		Check for folders that have "gameinfo.txt".
		Check for folders that have "studiomdl.exe".
		(Do not know how to find user name, so won't be checking the username folder.)
- Warn user if exiting while compile is in progress.
- Options for studiomdl compiler found in various versions of studiomdl.exe
- Each option for studiomdl compiler has a tooltip to describe the option.
- Include options for setting up a qc file.
	* StudioCompiler's Model Compile tab > Compile Model button is related to this.
- Compile materials/textures and dump them where the qc points to.
	* StudioCompiler's Material Compiler tab and VTF Export tab are related to this.
- For the Compile Log page, provide way to select from compiled models for viewing, going to, and recompiling.
	- Combobox for selecting from list of compiled models
	- Change the buttons to use "Selected Model"
	- Change "Recompile" button to "Recompile Selected".
	- Add "Recompile All" button enabled when more than one compiled.
- "Skip current model compile" button for batch compiling.
- Provide some way of viewing and deleting compiled models, so it's easier to remove unneeded ones.
- Provide options for compiling model to different folder.
	* Crowbar would simply move compiled model files to the user-given folder.
	- Add a new option in Set Up Games window: 
		- Label: "Compile Folder (folder where compiled model files are moved to)"
		- Textbox: full path
		- Button: "Use Default" (to left of Browse button)
		- Button: "Browse..." (rightmost button)
	- Provide an example game setup that uses a custom compile folder.
		* Example: "Counter-Strike Source (Fallout compile folder)" where folder is "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Source\fallout"



=== Error reporting ===

- Error report should have the following info:
	/ mdl or qc file name, depending on decompiling or compiling
	- paths used in the decompile or compile



### SUGGESTED FEATURES
################################################################################

- Tab for "Decompiled Model Info" or "Model Info" (for those who don't want to decompile, but want info).
	- mdl version number
	- material paths and file names
	- sequence and anim names with their equivalent numbers as shown in HLMV
- Have way to use vpk to package the model files.
	- "Pack" tab
	- Model mdl file name field auto-set to compiled model mdl file name
		OR
		"Select compiled model" button
	- Fields:
		- Release folder
		- Author
		- Steam account
		- Steam group
	- "Pack" button
	- "Pack" creates addon folders and files, calls vpk.exe
- Use crate as background image for Compile tab.
- Use intermodal container image for vpk process tab.
- "produce sharedbones option"
	* Possibly referring to this?:  
		sharedbones (set of $definebone lines) are needed to keep the bone order the same as 
		the mdl file holding the animations used via $includemodel line in the qc file
- Command-line options for decompiling from another program.
- Rotate a bone by a user-specified angle in all frames of all animations.
	12:35 - Stiffy360: wondering if it's possible to rotate a bone's axis including in all the animations without recompiling the model
	12:35 - Stiffy360: hexing models for gmod and discovered that the L4D rig mostly works
	12:36 - Stiffy360: excep the thumbs are facing the wrong way
	12:36 - Stiffy360: wanted to rotate the thumb bone's axis 180 degrees on the x-axis
	12:40 - Stiffy360: well I had a L4D weapon
	12:40 - Stiffy360: and I wanted to use GMOD's hands on it
	12:40 - Stiffy360: but the thumb bones are rotated the wrong way http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=224836643
	12:41 - Stiffy360: animations work fine
	12:41 - Stiffy360: it's I would have to rotate the bone 180 degrees in max
	12:42 - Stiffy360: for every frame of every animation
	12:42 - ZeqMacaw: indeed
	12:42 - Stiffy360: the ability to rotate bone axis in animations would help certain things
	12:42 - Stiffy360: like what I'm doing :p
	12:43 - ZeqMacaw: it seems like the feature would be more appropriate for a 3d tool, such as 3ds max, maybe using a script for it
	12:44 - Stiffy360: yeah
