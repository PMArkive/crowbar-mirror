If you do make edits and release them, please use a different name than Crowbar
and put your name in a "Modified by:" box in the About window or similar,
so people are not confused which version they are using.

For example, you could change the main window's title bar from "Crowbar" to "Crowbar Modified by YourName"
and add in a box in About window showing "Modified by: YourName".

Or rename your version to something completely different
and simply credit ZeqMacaw for providing source code that your modified version is based on.
