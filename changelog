Crowbar 0.55 - 2018-02-28_0.55

Changelog:

=== Set Up Games ===

    ADDED: Tactical Intervention game setup.


=== Unpack ===

    ADDED: Unpacking of Tactical Intervention FPX package files.
    ADDED: Unpacking of Garry's Mod GMA package files. Includes "unpacking" of an "addon.json" file that does not exist in the GMA package as a file, but as meta-data.


=== Decompile ===

    ADDED: MDL v10 - Checkbox for using UV values specifically for DoomMusic's model compiler, which handles the UVs slightly differently than the Valve compiler.
    ADDED: MDL v52 - Titanfall animation SMD files.
    ADDED: MDL v53 - Titanfall 2 reference and LoD meshes, animation SMD files, and (probably incomplete) QC file.
    FIXED: MDL v44 - Missing translational root-bone movement (walkframe LX LY LZ). (Rotational root-bone movement has not been fixed.)
    FIXED: MDL v44, v45, v46, v48, v49, v52 - Missing name value for $sequence ikrule attachment option.
    FIXED: MDL v44, v45, v46, v48, v49, v52 - Incorrect custom normals (smoothing groups) of concave physics mesh that has shared vertexes between convex sections.
    FIXED: All MDL versions - The rotate x value for $attachment sometimes is NaN instead of a number.


=== Options ===

    ADDED: Option to restrict to single instance (only one Crowbar open at a time).
