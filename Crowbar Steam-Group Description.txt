Crowbar Steam-Group Description



###### Before 2014-06-02
################################################################################

Crowbar is a tool that decompiles source engine models (such as those in Counter-Strike Source, Garry's Mod, Half-Life 2, Left 4 Dead 2, Portal 2, Source Filmmaker, and Team Fortress 2) and provides a convenient interface to Valve's model compiler.

Crowbar is intended to be a replacement for the famous MDL Decompiler made by Cannonfodder. MDL Decompiler has not been updated for many years and can't fully decompile the latest model versions used in source engine games. Crowbar is being developed to handle these later versions.

Crowbar decompiles source-engine models (mdl and ani file formats) and provides a convenient graphical interface to "studiomdl.exe", the command-line model compiler usually provided with each source-engine game.

Crowbar currently decompiles the latest source-engine models (~2007 and later, mdl versions 49 and later), replacing all other source-engine model decompilers such as MDL Decompiler and StudioCompiler made by Cannonfodder. Crowbar will eventually support all goldsrc-engine and source-engine mdl versions, both old and new.
